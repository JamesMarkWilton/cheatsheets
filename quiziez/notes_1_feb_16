  What patterns do you see in the JSON structures below?
  (find the balance between terse and descriptive)
    I see a title or name for what the object is surrounded by qoutes and delimmted via a :
    I then see a link that that object points to. I see anything that is being replaced has a
    place holder that is the name of that lets call it variable w/ {} around it some say a link
    wanted a person it would look like "https://link.com/{person}
  Ignoring that the data looked different, how many different structures of data were there?
  ie if you were to make up your syntax (format of characters that make up the data,
  ie "then you have to have a comma"), how many different types of data would you have to
  make up syntax for?
