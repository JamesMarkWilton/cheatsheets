# + this adds 2 floats together
3.3 + 4.4 = 7.7
# - this takes the 2nd float from the first
1.0 - .5 = .5
# < this checks to see if the float on the left is less than the float on the right returns a boolean
3.4 < 4.4 = true
# == this checks if 2 floats are equal and returns a boolean
3.3 == 3.3 => true
# > this checks to see if the float on the left is greater than the float on the right
3.3 > 4.4 => false
# <= this checks to see if the lfoat on the left is less than or equal too the float on the right and returns a boolean
3.3 <= 4.3 => ture
# >= this checks to see if the float on the left is greater than or equal to the float on the right and returns a boolean
