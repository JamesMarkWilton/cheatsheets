Git Workflow
------------

Model
----

* Every commit is immutable. It never changes.
* You're only ever adding. Never deleting.
* To delete you need to add a delete
* When you change the past, you're fucking everyone else in the present
* Your repository is an aggregation of all your commits... all your addtions and deletions
* A branch is a named commit
* Checksum or the code that is ran against your code to see if it is real, # attached to git

Cardinal Rules
-------------

* Commit constantly
* run git status after everything you do
